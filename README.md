# connect-mySQL-to-python 
This file is a Jupyter Notebook that contains a data analysis of a school database using Python. Here's an overview of its content:

1.Main Functions
Connecting to a MySQL Database:
-Uses the libraries pymysql and SQLAlchemy to connect to a database called "school".
-Displays the available tables in the database: courses, enrollments, grades, students, teachers.

2.Data Analysis:
-Reads and displays data of students, teachers, and grades.
-Performs basic statistical analysis of the data using pandas.
-Detects and handles outliers in the grades data.

3.Data Processing:
-Encodes categorical data using LabelEncoder and get_dummies.
-Applies MinMax scaling to student grades.
-Visualizes the data using matplotlib and seaborn.

Technologies Used:
1.Python with the following libraries:
-pandas for data analysis
-SQLAlchemy for database connection
-scikit-learn for data processing (LabelEncoder, MinMaxScaler)
-matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
2.MySQL as the database

Potential Uses
This code can be useful for:
-Analyzing student performance
-Identifying issues in grade data
-Preparing data for machine learning models
-Creating dashboards for school management

How to Run
To execute this code, you will need:
-To install the required libraries (pandas, SQLAlchemy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
-A running MySQL server with a "school" database
-To update the database connection credentials if necessary

This type of analysis is valuable for managing educational data and making data-driven decisions in educational institutions.
